    Configure Token Settings:
        Note: You may need to confirm your password.
        Give your token a descriptive name in the Note field.
        Set an expiration for the token (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.).
        Select the scopes or permissions you want to grant this token. For example:
            repo for full control of private repositories.
            workflow for updating GitHub Actions workflows.
            admin:org for managing organization settings.
